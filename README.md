Latest release of lane detection to be used on Bender

To get started ensure that you have python 3 and pip then, clone the repo download the venv file from the Google Drive (BenderSoftware/VisionVenv). This would have been included in the repo, but the files are too large, furthemore, setting up a dedicated enviroment for this would be difficult.

The detect.py file contains the logic for lane detection. The usage is described very clearly within the file and some examples of usage 
are provided in the run.sh script. This script has two useful examples of running the program. To run it, first grant permission, then execute the file:

$ chmod +x run.sh

$ ./run.sh
